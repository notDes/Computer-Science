// Directions:   Fill in the missing variables and methods to create the Store class.
// Their will only be 3 pieces of data for each store: the type of store (pet or grocery), the time the store opens and the time the store closes.
// To simplify the opening and closing times, our stores will only open and close on the hour.   The times will be stored in 24-hour format, so we will not be
// storing am or pm.   For example, 7 am will be stored as 7.   7pm will be stored as 19 (because 12 + 7 = 19).
// If a store has been created, you can assume that the closing time is after the opening time (and no stores are open 24 hours a day).


// When your program is complete:
// Double check that you have filled in your first name, last name and class period
// Upload your program to Canvas
